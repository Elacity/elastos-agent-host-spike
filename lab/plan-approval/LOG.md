# plan-approval lane log

> A proposal carries no authority.

- 001: `preview` returns the plan bytes and `agent_conformance::identity::sha256` of those bytes and calls no `StandIn` method; the exact-name test reads the stand-in only through `get_capability_list` and `get_capsules`; two hand-run plants caught and restored; 1 test, 2 plants.

## 001

Design text followed, [docs/AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md](../../docs/AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md) Request flow step 5:

> A proposal carries no authority.

Plant command, one plant at a time, each restored before the next:

```bash
cargo test --locked --manifest-path lab/plan-approval/Cargo.toml --lib preview_makes_no_effect -- --exact
```

### F-preview-writes-grant

- old bytes, 17: `let _ = stand_in;`
- new bytes, 164: `stand_in.seed_grant("req-plant", "component-1", "localhost://Public/plan-approval/a.txt", "read", "once", 1, agent_conformance::standin_runtime::Life::Live, false);`
- planted crate compiled; `preview_makes_no_effect` failed at `src/lib.rs:56:5` on the first unchanged-grants assertion: `assertion left == right failed: the preview returned the plan bytes, the hash is sha256 of those bytes, and the live grants and the capsule list are unchanged on a fresh stand-in`; left held the seeded `req-plant` entry, right was empty.
- restored, the test passes.

### F-preview-fixed-hash

- old bytes, 41: `agent_conformance::identity::sha256(plan)`
- new bytes, 77: `"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000".to_owned()` (the literal is 64 zeroes; `.to_owned()` makes it an owned `String` so the planted crate compiles, per the spec check).
- planted crate compiled; `preview_makes_no_effect` failed at `src/lib.rs:74:5` on the `previews[0].sha256` assertion: left `0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, right `156e544f8e98e81c5e504dfd7ed21d2adb703b8f9dafa8701b064255b69f85ae`.
- restored, the test passes.

After both restores, `git diff -- lab/plan-approval/src/lib.rs` shows no plant. The restored proof command took 0.56 s real. This lane has no `falsifiers.json`; the runner has no `plan-approval` command (BACKLOG item 3).
