# Probe contract

- The probe reserves one selector (`read:<path>`, `net:<resource>`, `model:<resource>` or `address:<instance>`) for one Bus attempt per activation; the current lifecycle entry returns `probe launch arguments are unavailable in elastos:bus@v1` until Runtime supplies the selector and result channel described in [GAPS.md](GAPS.md).

## 006 — launch, data directory and grant discovery

Runtime owns launch and grants; the fixture controller approves, the capsule
requests an effect, and the provider performs it. [GAPS.md](GAPS.md) is the single
blocker record and holds the detailed fixture recipe. This page records source
evidence only; live confirmation belongs to 003 after 007 supplies isolation.

**Launch.** `elastos run <component-directory>` and `elastos run --cid <bundle-CID>`
are non-interactive (`elastos/crates/elastos-server/src/main.rs:90-113`). The
component branch uses the operator Runtime, awaits activation and returns
(`elastos/crates/elastos-server/src/run_cmd.rs:51-60,225-269`). Start a fixture
operator first with `elastos serve --addr 127.0.0.1:<port> --storage-path <fixture-storage>`;
`run` requires its coordinates (`run_cmd.rs:165-170`). `--with` is native-provider
hosting (`run_cmd.rs:24-29`). The directory locates the candidate; the computed
hash identifies it, while launch by bundle CID still needs content preparation.

**Data directory.** `default_data_dir` is `dirs::data_dir()/elastos`
(`elastos/crates/elastos-server/src/sources.rs:12-17`). On this Mac, set child
`HOME` to the temporary fixture Home to obtain
`$HOME/Library/Application Support/elastos`; `XDG_DATA_HOME` applies to other
platforms. Task 007 verifies that resolved path and clears inherited
`ELASTOS_RUNTIME_COORDS_FILE` (`elastos/crates/elastos-server/src/runtime_control.rs:446-450`).
AC-006-STORAGE remains open: even the component branch constructs storage at
`/tmp/elastos/storage` (`run_cmd.rs:236`). Runtime must derive that path from the
selected Home before the fixture can claim complete temporary-root isolation.

**Grant decision.** seam exists (shell-authenticated operator HTTP API) —
fixture/command recipe 003 uses: obtain a fixture shell session through
`POST /api/auth/attach`, run a fixed-effect probe, match its exact request in
`GET /api/capability/pending`, then `POST /api/capability/grant` with its
`request_id` and `duration: "once"`. The API requires shell authority
(`elastos/crates/elastos-server/src/api/server.rs:258-277`); approval grants to
the requesting session (`elastos/crates/elastos-server/src/api/handlers/capability.rs:308-353`).
The guest bridge polls for the result for up to 30 seconds
(`elastos/crates/elastos-server/src/resource_bridge.rs:1386-1454`). Credentials
stay inside the future isolated fixture. `dev_mode` configures admission only
(`elastos/crates/elastos-server/src/runtime.rs:188-227`); for a pre-seeded home-file
grant seam: **none found**. Direct manager/store access in server tests is
test-internal (`runtime.rs:508,1026-1043`). 003 has a grant route to exercise once
007 and AC-006-STORAGE are resolved; each effect still needs its own proof.

**Effect channel.** AC-002-ARGS stays open: Bus v1 carries no launch selector or
success payload (`elastos/wit/elastos-bus-v1.wit:87`,
`elastos/crates/elastos-compute/src/providers/component.rs:133,183`). A typed
WIT selector/result plus ComponentProvider and CLI forwarding would close it.
One build-time-fixed effect can use the existing capability/provider imports
(`elastos-bus-v1.wit:72-95`). Propagated refusal reaches exit/stderr with the
source format `Component capsule denied: {err:?}` (`component.rs:135`). The
current probe returns only its unavailable reason. Live refusal, Mac path
resolution and real-Home byte identity: **to confirm in 003**. Zero Runtime
launches were made; the full Runtime build was skipped pending storage isolation.

Principles check (documentation scope; no behavior grade added):

| Question | Answer and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| 1. New name/URL in place of code/content hash? | No. CID launch stays canonical; `run_cmd.rs:127-138`. |
| 2. New ambient or UI authority? | No. The existing shell approval and Bus grant path stay separate; `api/server.rs:258-277`, `component.rs:398-409`. |
| 3. Second operation path or rule copy? | No. The existing CLI/API path is documented; this summary points to the single GAPS record. `run_cmd.rs:58`, `api/server.rs:261`. |
| 4. Does the trusted core grow? | No. Only this LOG and GAPS change; the proposed core work stays blocked. `component.rs:133`, `run_cmd.rs:236`. |
| 5. Clear fail-closed refusal? | Yes for the unchanged probe refusal; `lab/agent-conformance/probe/src/lib.rs:14-25`. Live effect grading remains with 003. |
| 6. Capsule logic stays inside and traps down? | Yes. The available effect interfaces are typed Bus imports; `elastos/wit/elastos-bus-v1.wit:72-95`. |
| 7. New rules have tests and caught falsifiers? | Yes within this docs-only scope: zero new executable rules, tests or falsifiers. Existing `probe_refuses_without_a_launch_argument_channel` at `probe/src/lib.rs:34-40` and F-ac2a in `README.md:43`; effect tests and their falsifiers belong to 003. |

Checks: lane `cargo fmt --manifest-path lab/agent-conformance/Cargo.toml -- --check`
and `cargo test --locked --manifest-path lab/agent-conformance/Cargo.toml` passed
offline with `RUST_TEST_THREADS=2 CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0` under the shared build
lease: 6 tests, 0 failures, 0 ignored. The basic repo gate also passed
(`git diff --check`, product-data check and its 99 tests, Runtime and
chain-provider formatting). Falsifiers were unchanged and were not rerun.
Only GAPS and LOG are tracked edits; clean status awaits the supervisor's
commit because this builder has no git-mutation authority.

- 006: Extended GAPS and this LOG with the source-traced launch, Mac Home rule, HTTP grant recipe, fixed-effect refusal channel and AC-006-STORAGE isolation blocker; probe and harness code stay unchanged.

## 008 — throwaway Home and bounded launch

- 008: Added `ThrowawayHome::{new,create_at,guard,launch,finish}`, the single Mac `data_dir` rule, three harness tests, the Cargo result table and its test, RUNBOOK, and the lane's one falsifier list; Runtime and probe sources stay unchanged.

The harness owns a fresh root under `target/`. It checks the selected Home and
data path before using either, clears the child environment, sets HOME/TMPDIR
and the fixed system PATH, and bounds each child. The primitive is exercised
with `/usr/bin/env`, `/bin/sh` and `/bin/sleep`; task 009 owns Runtime launch
acceptance. Successful tests remove their roots. The three deliberate harness
failures below retain their roots for supervisor review, with removal after
that review. The private local lifecycle inventory records those roots.

`falsifiers.json` is the one list. F-probe-a through F-probe-f carry the six
002 mutations formerly named F-ac2a through F-ac2f. Their exact anchors were
checked against the unchanged source, and all six existing tests passed.
The provider lane owns `falsify.py`; lab falsifiers run by hand until it adds
a `lab` arm. The four new entries were each applied once, run, restored from
the original bytes, and rerun. F-report-a covers the new table rule.

Commands below ran from the repository root under the existing shared
heavy-build lease. The local invocation used Python `subprocess.run` with the
following complete environment; HOME supplies only its path value, and the
extra inherited variables contain synthetic fixture values. Thus F-ac1d's
captured environment contains fixture data only. Each `edits` replacement
from `falsifiers.json` was applied with `original.replace(old, new, 1)` after
asserting one match, and restored with `path.write_bytes(original)` in `finally`.
There was no Git mutation or shared-runner change.

```python
lane = pathlib.Path('lab/agent-conformance')
tmp = lane / 'target/falsifier-tmp'
env = dict(
    HOME=os.environ['HOME'], PATH=os.environ['PATH'],
    CARGO_NET_OFFLINE='true',
    CARGO_TARGET_DIR=str((lane / 'target/host').absolute()),
    CARGO_BUILD_BUILD_DIR=str((lane / 'target/host-build').absolute()),
    TMPDIR=str(tmp.absolute()), RUST_TEST_THREADS='2', CARGO_INCREMENTAL='0',
    ELASTOS_RUNTIME_COORDS_FILE=str((tmp / 'absent-coords').absolute()),
    ELASTOS_FIXTURE_ONLY='fixture', XDG_DATA_HOME=str(tmp.absolute()),
    XDG_CONFIG_HOME=str(tmp.absolute()), SPARKS_MODEL_URL='fixture.invalid',
)
```

Each following Cargo command ran once with the mutation (exit 101) and once
after restoration (exit 0). The blocks preserve the captured output. The
failures are test assertions on returned results; every named test ran.

Final checks: lane formatting and `run.sh` passed offline with
`RUST_TEST_THREADS=2 CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`. The script ran
`cargo test --locked --manifest-path lab/agent-conformance/Cargo.toml -- --list`
and the same test command with `--no-fail-fast -- --format pretty --color never`.
The complete suite has 10 passed, 0 failed and 0 ignored tests. Its exact table:

```text

```

`git diff --check`, `bash -n lab/agent-conformance/run.sh`, the product-data
check (42 capsules, 2 profiles, 28 method contracts), its 99 tests, and Runtime
and chain-provider formatting also passed. All 10 falsifier IDs are unique,
all commands are `lab`, and every exact edit anchor matches the restored source.
The full run left both source hashes and `git status --porcelain` unchanged;
its generated files are ignored. The builder leaves the source edits for the
supervisor's commit, so an empty Git status follows that commit. The local
branch is 0 ahead / 0 behind its cached `spike/spike/agent-host` upstream;
network restrictions leave remote freshness unverified. GAPS, Cargo manifests,
the lockfile, artifact tests, and probe source have zero changes. PR creation
and independent review belong to the supervisor; the commands and output above
are ready for its PR evidence.

Principles check (paths below are relative to this lane):

| Question | Answer and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| 1. New name or URL where a code/content hash belongs? | No. The unchanged artifact check still compares SHA-256 values; `tests/artifact.rs:144`. System-tool paths locate the test tools. |
| 2. New ambient or UI authority? | No. `src/harness.rs:192` runs the guard and `src/harness.rs:204` clears the child environment before setting its three entries. |
| 3. A second operation path or rule copy? | No. `src/harness.rs:14` owns the Mac data rule and `src/harness.rs:191` owns the only Runtime process primitive; `src/report.rs:19` owns result grading. |
| 4. Does the trusted core grow? | No. The additions are lane modules in `src/lib.rs:3`; the Runtime and provider trees have zero changes. |
| 5. Does refusal fail closed with a reason? | Yes. `src/harness.rs:165` returns distinct guard reasons; `tests/harness.rs:7` asserts them, and `tests/harness.rs:128` asserts the timeout reason. |
| 6. Does capsule logic stay inside and trap down? | Yes. The probe stays unchanged with typed Bus bindings at `probe/src/lib.rs:8` and its internal refusal at `probe/src/lib.rs:14`. |
| 7. Do new rules have tests and caught falsifiers? | Yes. `tests/harness.rs:7`, `tests/harness.rs:82`, `tests/harness.rs:124` and `tests/report.rs:4` passed, failed under their listed mutations, and passed after restoration; exact results are above. |

## 010 — operator in a throwaway home, source discovery

Runtime owns the fixture operator and its provider processes. Task 003 takes
its live-or-BLOCKED decision from the single verdict in
[GAPS.md: Operator in a throwaway home](GAPS.md#operator-in-a-throwaway-home).
AC-010-OFFLINE stays open: Carrier's loopback bind and environment-only LAN
discovery control are separate. The lane supplies exactly HOME, TMPDIR and
PATH (`src/harness.rs:201-207`; `tests/harness.rs:82-105`). The verdict names
the Home-config change needed for this fixture; live traffic proof is pending.

Plain `serve` requires a verified `bin/localhost-provider` and its
`components.json` entry. DID and shell are optional on this path; the managed
Home list is separate (`elastos/crates/elastos-server/src/server_infra.rs:740-806`;
`serve_cmd.rs:327-366`; `runtime_control.rs:1269-1291` in that server directory).
GAPS records manifest fields, SHA-256 verification and offline build commands.
Provider compilation and cache completeness remain unmeasured.

The file table covers the host lock, config, device identity, capability state,
TLS files, canonical roots, installed binary and coordinates. Keys appear by
file name and role only. A fresh Home has an empty community bootstrap list
(`collaboration_startup.rs:78-89,164-180`); passing that list alone proves no dial.

Readiness requires coordinates plus live loopback health before `run` performs
its own attach checks (`serve_cmd.rs:437-446`; `runtime_control.rs:769-810`).
SIGTERM reaches the owned process group, with a two-second forced-stop bound
(`main.rs:1284-1322`). `serve --storage-path` can select an in-root directory;
AC-006-STORAGE remains attached to `run`'s fixed constructor (`serve_cmd.rs:47`;
`run_cmd.rs:236`). An unsigned source probe requires Home-local `dev_mode = true`
and remains subject to grants (`runtime.rs:181-227`).

Checks ran offline with `RUST_TEST_THREADS=2 CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`:

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `cargo fmt --manifest-path lab/agent-conformance/Cargo.toml -- --check` | Exit 0. |
| `cargo test --locked --manifest-path lab/agent-conformance/Cargo.toml` | Exit 0; 10 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored. |
| `git diff --check` | Exit 0. |
| `node scripts/check-product-data.mjs` and `node --test scripts/check-product-data.test.mjs` | 42 capsules, 2 profiles, 28 method contracts; 99 tests passed. |
| `(cd elastos && cargo fmt --all -- --check)` and chain-provider formatting | Both exit 0. |

Cargo used `CARGO_NET_OFFLINE=true`; target, intermediate and temporary outputs
stayed in this lane's `target/`. The required suite built the probe twice.
Runtime/provider builds, Runtime launches and network calls: zero. New tests
and falsifiers: zero; this documentation change leaves executable rules intact.
Existing falsifiers were unchanged and were not rerun.

The worktree began clean; generated check artifacts were removed. GAPS and LOG
remain for the supervisor's commit, so `git status --short` lists those two
edits. Cached upstream comparison is 0 ahead / 0 behind
`spike/spike/agent-host`; remote freshness is unverified. Git state is unchanged.

Principles check (paths without a prefix below are relative to this lane):

| Question | Answer and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| 1. New name/URL where a hash belongs? | No. Provider code is identified by its installed byte checksum; `GAPS.md:157-169`. |
| 2. New ambient or UI authority? | No. The existing launch environment stays fixed; `src/harness.rs:201-207`. |
| 3. Second operation path or rule copy? | No. This summary links the one operator verdict; `GAPS.md:83-92`. |
| 4. Does the trusted core grow? | No. The Runtime change is an open blocker, with zero Runtime edits; `GAPS.md:85`. |
| 5. Clear fail-closed refusal? | Yes. 003 is explicitly BLOCKED pending the Home-config control and traffic proof; `GAPS.md:85`. |
| 6. Capsule logic stays inside and traps down? | Yes. The typed Bus entry and internal refusal are unchanged; `probe/src/lib.rs:8-25`. |
| 7. New executable rules have tests and caught falsifiers? | Yes within documentation scope: zero new executable rules. The existing environment test stays intact; `tests/harness.rs:82-105`. This discovery claims no new falsifier result. |

- 010: Extended the single GAPS record and this summary with operator startup files, provider checks/build commands, network controls, readiness/stop/admission evidence and AC-010-OFFLINE; clarified the separate AC-006-STORAGE scope.
