# Agent conformance checks

From the repository root on the Mac, with the shared heavy-build lease held, run:

```sh
lab/agent-conformance/run.sh
```

The command uses cached dependencies, the pinned Rust toolchain and its
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` target. Reserve 2 GiB for builds plus 2 GiB free. The
lease procedure is in [scripts/README.md](../../scripts/README.md#local-pre-push-gate).
The command prints one table from Cargo's test inventory and result lines.
`ok` becomes PASS. `ignored, blocked: <id> …` becomes BLOCKED with that ID.
A failure, missing result, repeated result, ignored test without a blocker ID,
or Cargo error gives FAIL and a non-zero command exit status. BLOCKED rows
remain open in [GAPS.md](GAPS.md).

- `home_is_throwaway`: checks the Mac data path, fresh root, path guard, symlink refusals and removal after success.
- `launch_env_is_only_the_throwaway_home`: checks the three allowed environment entries, null stdin, exit status and both output streams.
- `launch_stops_a_child_past_its_bound`: checks that a one-second bound stops a three-second sleep with the exact timeout reason.
- `run_table_requires_cargo_results`: checks PASS, BLOCKED and FAIL grading against Cargo-format result fixtures.
- `foreign_and_wrong_version_imports_are_refused`: rejects imports outside the probe's Bus subset.
- `non_component_and_invalid_component_are_refused`: rejects a core module and invalid component bytes.
- `probe_hash_is_stable`: compares the SHA-256 values from two fresh builds on this Mac.
- `probe_imports_only_the_bus`: checks the imports of both built components.
- `probe_manifest_names_the_current_bus_world`: checks the WIT hash and component manifest fields.
- `tests::probe_refuses_without_a_launch_argument_channel`: checks the probe's explicit unavailable result.
- `cargo` (failure only): Cargo could not supply a complete test inventory or finish the suite.

The harness owns each fresh root under this lane's ignored `target/`. It checks
HOME and the derived data path before reading those paths or starting a child.
The launch primitive clears the parent environment and sets HOME, TMPDIR and
the fixed system PATH. The environment test checks that complete allowlist.
F-ac1c selects the inherited HOME and proves the guard refuses it before any
read. These checks protect the real Home by construction; they never read its
data. The fixture stores a selector, rather than a user's Home path.

These rows prove the harness and probe artifact rules. Task 009 supplies the
first Runtime launch proof. Later Runtime tests use `harness::ThrowawayHome::launch`;
operator support extends that same primitive.

A passed test removes its root. A failed test prints and retains its root for
inspection. A failed command also retains Cargo output under `target/run-table.*`.
Keep each failed root only until its result is reviewed, then remove that root.
The [falsifier list](falsifiers.json) owns the exact mutations; [LOG.md](LOG.md)
records their local runs. The provider lane owns the shared runner's `lab` arm;
until it is available, apply and restore each mutation by hand.
