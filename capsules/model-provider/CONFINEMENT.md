# model-provider confinement

`confine.sb` is the one source of the model provider's confinement profile
(P10). It starts with `(version 1)`, then `(deny default)`, then
`(deny network*)`. The provider reads line-delimited JSON on stdin and writes
one JSON answer per line on stdout. The profile grants it no socket and no
listener. Every operation that no rule grants is refused (P3, P11).

## Parameters

The profile uses only the three parameter tokens every file profile binds:

- `PROVIDER_EXECUTABLE`: the canonical path of the provider binary.
- `STORAGE_ROOT`: the model journal root. That is
  `Init.base_path/providers/model-provider`, or the configured absolute
  `journal_dir`.
- `STORAGE_PARENT`: the parent of `STORAGE_ROOT`. Under the shared contract the
  Runtime creates it before launch. The provider creates `STORAGE_ROOT` itself
  at its first `init`.

All three are resolved paths. The sandbox matches the resolved path, so a
path through a link (macOS `/var` is `/private/var`) would match nothing.

## The Runtime half

The model provider presents the same file-profile contract as `did-provider`
and `wallet-provider`: one profile file, the same head forms, the same three
parameter tokens and the same three shared rules. The Runtime half of that
contract is "The Runtime bridge change" in `../did-provider/CONFINEMENT.md` and
`../wallet-provider/CONFINEMENT.md`. The model provider needs nothing from the
Runtime beyond that one parameterized launch and that one profile check. There
is no separate Runtime proposal for the model provider (P10).

## What the profile allows

Each rule is load-bearing: removing it alone makes
`model_provider_ops_under_profile` fail, as the named falsifier shows.

| Rule | Why the provider needs it | Without it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `(allow process-exec (literal (param "PROVIDER_EXECUTABLE")))` | Start only the binary bound as `PROVIDER_EXECUTABLE`. | F-cc1-rm-exec: `sandbox-exec` cannot execute the binary and exits 71. |
| `(allow file-read-data (literal "/"))` | Process startup reads the root directory before `main` runs; `/bin/echo` aborts the same way without it, so this is not provider code. A metadata-only grant is not enough. | F-cc1-rm-rootdir: the process aborts (SIGABRT) before its first answer, with no output. |
| `(allow sysctl-read)` | At startup the Rust runtime reads the page size to place its stack guard page. These are read-only kernel facts. | F-cc1-rm-sysctl: the runtime panics with "failed to allocate a guard page" before `main` and the process aborts (SIGABRT). |
| `(allow file-read* (literal (param "STORAGE_PARENT")))` | `init` inspects the existing parent before it creates the journal root. The grant is literal: the parent directory itself, nothing below it. | F-cc1-rm-parent: `init` answers `journal_corrupt`; the provider logs EPERM for the parent. |
| `(allow file-read* file-write* (subpath (param "STORAGE_ROOT")))` | One grant covers the journal root, `runs/` and every run record under it. | F-cc1-rm-storage: `init` answers `journal_access_denied` (provider task 012); the provider logs EPERM creating the journal root. |

There is no `(allow default)`, no network allow, no unfiltered `file-read*`
and no `(subpath "/")`.

The did and wallet profiles were the starting set. These startup grants from
that set are not in this profile, because the provider starts and serves
`init`, `status` and `offers_list` without them, and
`model_provider_ops_under_profile` passes: a read of the provider binary
itself, reads under `/usr/lib`, `/System/Library` and `/Library/Apple`, and
access to `/dev/null` and `/dev/urandom`. The root directory read is narrowed
from the starting set's `file-read*` to `file-read-data`, the one class that
startup needs.

`(deny network*)` is held by the shared contract check, not by a behaviour
test here (see Tests).

## Tests

`tests/confine/main.rs` (the cargo test target `confine`) holds this crate's
one sandboxed launcher. It runs the built binary under
`/usr/bin/sandbox-exec -f confine.sb`, binds the three parameters to resolved
paths, and speaks the normal stdin/stdout protocol. `sandbox-exec` reads
`confine.sb` from `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` at every launch, so an edit to the
profile takes effect without a rebuild. The `init` config carries one hosted
offer, which touches no file at `init`. A local engine offer reads files
outside `STORAGE_ROOT`, and this profile does not grant them.

- `model_provider_ops_under_profile`: `STORAGE_PARENT` exists at launch and
  `STORAGE_ROOT` does not. The test drives `init`, `status` and `offers_list`,
  checks each answer, and checks that `init` created `runs/` under
  `STORAGE_ROOT`. It then shuts the provider down and requires a clean exit.
- `model_outside_write_denied`: the fixture creates `STORAGE_ROOT` to hold a
  link: `STORAGE_ROOT/escape` is a symlink to `STORAGE_PARENT/outside`, a
  sibling of the journal root. `init` names the journal path
  `STORAGE_ROOT/escape/inner`, so the path looks inside the root but leads
  outside. The link is an intermediate because the provider refuses a
  symlinked journal root, run directory or run file. `outside/inner` already
  exists because the provider also refuses to create a directory under a
  symlinked parent. The test requires:
  - the answer `status: error`, `code: journal_corrupt`;
  - the provider's stderr line
    `[model-provider] journal_corrupt: ... <journal path>: Operation not permitted`;
  - the outside sibling unchanged: the same entries, modes and bytes;
  - a later normal `init` on `STORAGE_ROOT` succeeds.
- `redirect_journal_materializes_outside_when_unconfined`: the control. The
  same fixture and the same request, without the profile, answer `status: ok`
  and create the journal (`outside/inner/runs`) under the outside sibling.

`journal_corrupt` is the provider's existing code for an unavailable journal,
and the JSON answer carries only that code. The detail goes to stderr only.
EPERM (`Operation not permitted`) on the redirected path is how the macOS
sandbox refuses; a corrupt journal or a bad request logs a different detail.
The control shows that the same request succeeds without the profile, so the
profile is the only difference between the two runs.

The confined tests print a skip reason and return when `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec`
is absent. When it is present and the sandbox refuses to launch the binary,
they fail. The control needs no sandbox and runs on every Unix host.

The profile shape has one check (P10):
`both_file_profiles_bind_one_storage_parameter_contract` in
`../wallet-provider/tests/confine.rs` runs over this file whenever it exists.
It requires `(version 1)` first, `(deny default)` second, `(deny network*)`,
no network allow, only the three parameter tokens, the three shared rules
verbatim, and no `(allow default)`. This crate adds no second shape test.

Run from the repository root:

```bash
cargo test --locked --manifest-path capsules/model-provider/Cargo.toml --test confine
cargo test --locked --manifest-path capsules/wallet-provider/Cargo.toml --test confine
python3 -I examples/agent-host/falsify.py --from capsules/model-provider/confine-falsifiers.json
```

## Falsifiers

`confine-falsifiers.json` holds this profile's falsifiers for the shared
runner. Every entry uses command `provider` and `expect: caught`, and each
mutates `confine.sb` only.

| Id | Mutation | Named test | Why the test fails |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F-cc1a | `(deny default)` becomes `(allow default)`; `(version 1)` stays first | `model_outside_write_denied` | The redirected `init` answers `ok`. |
| F-cc1b | The `STORAGE_ROOT` read/write grant's subpath becomes `STORAGE_PARENT` | `model_outside_write_denied` | The redirected `init` answers `ok`, so the test checks the boundary itself. |
| F-cc1-rm-exec | Remove the `process-exec` rule | `model_provider_ops_under_profile` | No answer to `init`: exit status 71. |
| F-cc1-rm-rootdir | Remove the root directory read | `model_provider_ops_under_profile` | No answer to `init`: SIGABRT. |
| F-cc1-rm-sysctl | Remove `(allow sysctl-read)` | `model_provider_ops_under_profile` | No answer to `init`: SIGABRT. |
| F-cc1-rm-parent | Remove the `STORAGE_PARENT` read | `model_provider_ops_under_profile` | `init` answers `journal_corrupt`. |
| F-cc1-rm-storage | Remove the `STORAGE_ROOT` read/write grant | `model_provider_ops_under_profile` | `init` answers `journal_access_denied` (provider task 012). |

The list is a Mac gate. Without `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec` the confined tests
skip and pass, so the runner reports each entry as SURVIVED there.

The runner's `provider` command runs only this crate, so the `(deny network*)`
falsifier is applied by hand: delete `(deny network*)` from `confine.sb` and
run the wallet command above.
`both_file_profiles_bind_one_storage_parameter_contract` then fails with
"model-provider must deny the network explicitly with (deny network*)".
Restore the file and it passes. The check itself is guarded by WP06 in
`../wallet-provider/falsifiers.json`, which deletes the `(deny network*)`
requirement from the check.
